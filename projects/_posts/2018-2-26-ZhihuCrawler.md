Zhihu is a Chinese question-and-answer website where all kinds of questions are created, answered, edited and organized by the community of its users. We designed and implemented the multithreading breadth-first-algorithm to capture all topic-related contents and stored them with fixed and readable structure. Detail implementation is shown in [Github repo](https://github.com/ranery/ZhihuCrawler).
