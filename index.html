        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a master student of <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn">Zhejiang University</a>, majoring in <a href="http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/">Computer Science and Technology</a>. Currently I am a research assistant co-advised by <a href="http://yangy.org">Yang Yang</a> and <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/wufei">Fei Wu</a> in <a href="http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn">Digital media Computing & Design Lab</a>. I also fortunately have <a href="https://www.chenhaot.com">Chenhao Tan</a> from <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado Boulder</a> as my external advisor.

        My research focuses on urban computing with heterogeneous data sources:
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Migrant integration in urbanization</b>: The unprecedented large-scale migration poses both significant challenges for policymakers and important questions for researchers. To understand the process of migrant integration, we employ a user telecommunication metadata in Shanghai and study systematic differences between locals and migrants in their mobile communication networks and geographical locations, and demonstrate the integration process of new migrants. (<a href="/publications/urban_dream.pdf">Yang et al., AAAI'18</a>)</li>
            <li> <b> Early departure of new migrants</b>: In the rapid urbanization process, many of migrants fail to settle down and eventually leave the city. To examine the disintegration process for some migrants who left early, we employ a novel dataset combining user telecommunication metadata and housing price, and investigate migrants’ behavior in their first weeks. At last, we formulate a churn prediction problem to determine whether a migrant is going to leave based on his/her behavior in the first few days.(<a href="/publications/migrant_churn.pdf">Yang et al., WWW'18</a>)</li>
            <li> <b>Imputation for residents' power usage</b>: Different time series data (e.g., power usage, real-time voltage) is measured in residents' daily life. A common challenge for using such data for mining people's behaviorial patterns is the imputation of the missing values with reasonable ones. We study the social-aware time series imputation problem and propose a sequential encoder-decoder-based imputation framework with an attention mechanism combining social context and temporal context.

        </ul>
